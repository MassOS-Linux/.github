# Welcome To MassOS
MassOS is a completely independent GNU/Linux distribution for laptops and desktops, which is designed to be lightweight without compromising on features. It is built from scratch and aims to provide the latest and greatest versions of software. New releases of MassOS are published monthly (sometimes fortnightly), ensuring the software doesn't get out of date. The default graphical environment is [Xfce](https://xfce.org), however ports of some other popular desktop environments are currently in development.
